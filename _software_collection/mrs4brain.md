abstract: "The MRS4Brain Toolbox is developed by MRS4Brain research group @ CIBM MRI EPFL AIT and was designed to offer advanced functionalities for Bruker preclinical MRSI data, encompassing preprocessing, fitting, quantification, semi-automatic quality control, co-registration and segmentation of metabolic maps using anatomical images, all conveniently integrated within a single open-source graphical user interface (GUI). The development of this user-friendly toolbox aims to streamline the processing workflow and enhance the accessibility of MRSI for researchers in the preclinical field. The MRS4Brain Toolbox is written in MATLAB 2023 or later (MathWorks, USA) and encompasses three distinct spectroscopy modalities (MRSI, single voxel MRS, dMRS), with our primary focus directed towards MRSI."
