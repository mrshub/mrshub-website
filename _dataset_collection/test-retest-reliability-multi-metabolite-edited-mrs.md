abstract: A study investigating the test-retest reliability of multi‐metabolite edited MRS at 3T. Data were acquired from 16 (13 available in repository) healthy adult participants in two separate sessions. In each session, HERMES and HERCULES data were acquired using both PRESS and sLASER localization from a single voxel placed in the medial parietal lobe of the brain.
